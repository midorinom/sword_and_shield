One minigame requires the mouse, you have to click 3 green boxes that appear at random spots on the screen. The other minigame requires the keyboard, you are shown 3 random characters in the center of the screen and you will have to press those keys. If you successfully clear the minigame within the time limit, you will block the enemy's attack entirely and land a counterattack of your own.

              <span>[Enemy Attacks] <br></span> The enemy also has an Action Gauge that fills over time and it will automatically attack when the gauge is full. The enemy chooses from various attacks, with its next attacks being queued up to the right of the Action Gauge. Enemies in later stages can use attacks that stun you, which stops your Action Gauge from filling. Parrying these attacks will prevent you from being stunned.
