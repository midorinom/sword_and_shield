# Introduction

This game project was created as part of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course. The requirement was to make a finished game using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

When brainstorming for ideas, I figured that making some sort of RPG game would be the best approach. For a RPG game, it would be easy to think up ways of incorporating the various concepts that I have learned in the course such as classes, arrays, objects and events. In particular, a turn-based game sounded like a great idea as there would be no character movement or map generation required. The focus would be on stats and combat, which seemed manageable enough for a first-ever coding project.

In this document I will explain the rationale behind the game design of various features as well as the code that makes them work.

**[WARNING]** it will contain spoilers for the game with information such as optimal gameplay decisions and backend math (I.E. probabilities of various mechanics, stat and damage formulas), so do stop reading past this section if you would like to experience the game blind.

I do not own any of the assets and images that I used in this project, I obtained them from free sources online which I have credited in this [asset_credits.txt](asset_credits.txt) file.
