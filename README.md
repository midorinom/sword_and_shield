# Introduction
This game project was created as part of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course. The requirement was to make a finished game using
HTML, CSS and Javascript. To make the most use of the HTML, CSS and Javascript knowledge that I have learned, I figured that making some sort of RPG game would be the best approach. A turn-based game sounded like a great idea as there would be no character movement required and the focus would be mostly on the combat.  

In this document I will explain the rationale behind the game design of various features as well as the code that makes them work. **[Be warned]** it will contain spoilers for the game with information such as optimal gameplay decisions and backend math (I.E. probabilities of various mechanics, stat and damage formulas), so do stop reading past this section if you would like to experience the game blind.

I do not own any of the assets and images that I used in this project, I obtained them from free sources online which I have credited in this [asset_credits.txt](asset_credits.txt) file.
